//! Shared coordination bus for a team of AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor — any MCP client).
//!
//! The crate is split so integration tests can drive the real HTTP surface:
//!
//! - [`store`] holds all business logic and every SQL statement,
//! - [`tools`] is a thin MCP layer over it,
//! - [`serve`] wires the transport, authentication and axum together,
//! - [`admin`] is the operator CLI (teams, agents, tokens).

// Row tuples for `sqlx::query_as` are spelled out next to the SELECT that
// produces them; naming each one would only add indirection.
