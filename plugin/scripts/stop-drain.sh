# Stop hook: answer a teammate's blocking question before going quiet.
#
# A coding agent only calls MCP tools while it is processing a turn. A session
# parked at the prompt polls nothing, so a question addressed to it would sit
# unread until its human typed something. This hook closes the most useful part
# of that gap: on the way out, look for a question, and if there is one, hold
# the session open long enough to answer it.
#
# It cannot close the gap entirely — a session that has been idle for an hour
# still answers nothing. That is a property of the client, not of the bus.
#
# Always exits 0 and prints nothing when there is no question, when the bus is
# unreachable, or when the bus is not configured at all.
